Question 24
Level 1

Question:
    Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read documentation online or find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.
    Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()
    And add document for your own function
    
Hints:
    The built-in document method is __doc__
